# Common_Bean_RNA-Seq_Coexpression_Network

This repo contains correlation coefficient based on 85 RNA-Seq datasets downloaded from the [NCBI SRA archive] (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra).

The list of the downloaded files with the SRA accessions are in the '

These data could be used for inferring a coexpression network for this species based.

In the folder "raw_coexpression" contains 18053 files named with common bean gene ID accordingly to [Phytozome platform] (www.phytozome.net'). Each file is a tab delimited file with 2 columns:

1 GeneID 
2 Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) between the gene that named the file and the gene in column 1.
